# PythonODBC
Python ODBC API project

This is continuation of my previous article Database Connectivity and Transaction in Python (https://dzone.com/articles/database-transaction-in-python). I strongly recomend you to read the above article first. Here I am going to explain how to design your own generic odbc API class in python through which you can connect to Oracle, MS SQL server, Sybase and MySql etc. database. Also here I have added one more API through which you can access columns of a table with their respective column name.

Lets start
1.        Download python 3.0 or above
2.       Download and install cx_Oracle to connect to Oracle database
3.        Download and install pyodbc to connect to sql server, Sybase, mysql etc.
